## Set Access Control for the AAD application
**V7.1.0**

A user will need to provide **Access Control** to an [AAD Application](./aad-application) for the application to manage the user's Azure Services (Key Vault, DNS Zone and App Services).

- Go to Azure **Subscriptions**, and open the subscription that contains your Azure Key Vault, DNS Zone, App Services

- In the subscription, click on 'Access control (IAM)' and add a new **role assignment**

**You must repeat these steps for each Azure Subscription that a user may wish to access.**

## Access Policies for Key Vault

If a user is creating SSL/TLS certificates for **Azure Key Vault**, they will need to set **Access policies** for the certificate in Key Vault. 

**This step is not required, if SSL/TLS certificates are not being created for Key Vault.**

- In Azure **Key Vault**, click on 'Access policies' and 'Add Access Policy'

- In the 'Certificate permissions' dropdown, select all **16 permissions**, including 'Purge' permission.
